# Mirror Music

Mirror Music is an interactive synthesizer that generates random pitches within a user specified key, triggered by motion, and characterized in range and timbre by color. It was completed for the final project of Professor Dafna Naphtali's Advanced Max/MSP/Jitter Programming course at the NYU Music Technology department.

It requires the following externals from [cv.jit](https://github.com/Cycling74/cv.jit):
